By using bikes.py you can count the flow of bikes that are going through selected bike stations located in a city of your choosing. I've chosen Cracow because I had the data from the public bikes. Data is provided in limited amout just to check how all of it works. You can modify and use this python file freely.
So in conclusion, you must have coordinates of the bike stations and data about where did a bike was set aside in a form of cooridnates.
